# Operation Blackout 2025: Ghost Thread 

## Sherlock Scenario
Byte Doctor suspects the attacker used a process injection technique to run malicious code within a legitimate process, leaving minimal traces on the file system. The logs reveal Win32 API calls that hint at a specific injection method used in the attack. Your task is to analyze these logs using a tool called API Monitor to uncover the injection technique and identify which legitimate process was targeted.
